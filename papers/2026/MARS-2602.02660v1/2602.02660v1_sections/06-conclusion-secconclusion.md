# Conclusion {#sec:conclusion}

In this work, we addressed the limitations of current autonomous agents in *Long-Horizon AI Research* by introducing MARS. Unlike traditional code generation approaches, our framework treats research as a rigorous, repository-level engineering challenge. By integrating *Resource-Aware Planning* via Budget-Aware MCTS, *Modular Construction*, and *Reflective Memory*, MARS effectively resolves the credit assignment problem while balancing exploration with computational efficiency. Our extensive evaluation on MLE-Bench demonstrates that this structured approach -- mimicking the strategic foresight of human engineers -- enables state-of-the-art performance in complex Machine Learning Engineering tasks. Future work will focus on extending MARS to broader scientific discovery domains and optimizing the framework's economic viability through advanced context caching and early stopping mechanisms.
